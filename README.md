Local Weather Dashboard
Description:
This is my local weather dashboard. The user inputs their city into the search box and it will pull up the local weather for that area and the 5 day forecast. This app uses a number of API's such as Open Weather, Moment JS, and Bootstrap. This project was the most challenging yet. Not only did I have to create the app from scratch but the JS portion was very difficult. The toughest part was figuring out how to save the data to local storage. I enjoyed this project and one positive thing was seeing the progress I have made since starting this course. I plan on continuing to work on this project and resubmit.
